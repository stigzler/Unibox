V1.0.0.0
New Feature:
- Can now delete games (deletes both the rom file and launchbox database entry). Deleted games now moved to recycle bin via Microsoft.VisualBasic.FileIO.FileSystem.DeleteFile (keeping it old skool)
Improvements: 
- Changed icons to Fluent style and various UI improvements.
- Database now resides in AppData folder instead of program folder to avoid permission issues alongside re-installation of app etc (auto-moves any existing dbs in app root folder)
- Added links to Forum post and github repo on About page
- Double Click games list row to edit

V0.9.13
New Features:
- Edit Game metadata and media on the fly without needing to spark up launchbox. Changes apply immediately in both Launchbox and BigBox
- Shows all present media for a game and allows you to edit or upload a primary file for each media type (images, videos, music, manuals). 
- One click for automatic websearch on Platform, game name and media type. 

V0.9.9 and lower
