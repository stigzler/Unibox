# V2 Planning

## Features

- Now Playing (with unobtrusive buttons to change image, open manual etc)
- Cross platform - let's learn Avalonia!
- Try do it all via plugin system - no messing with xmls directly
- Installer
- ? Signed ?
- Full screen rather than windowed
- 

## Approach

### Foundations:

1. Unified plugin hooks - see Gearbox for the right approach - requires some kind of singleton
1. Get messaging set up right - must alow for multiple servers (each installation) with multiple clients (app on different machines)
1. UI design
