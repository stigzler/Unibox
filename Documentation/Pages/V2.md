- Try do it all via plugin system - no messing with xmls directly
- Installer
- ? Signed ?
- Full screen rather than windowed
- Automated updates

## Approach

### Foundations:

1. Solution Structure
   1. Data: 
		1. Models
		1. Enums
		1. Constants
		1. Maps (e.g. Screenscraper to Launchbox maps)
		1. 
	1. Services:
	1. UI
	1. Plugin (for inteface)

1. Unified plugin hooks - see Gearbox for the right approach - requires some kind of singleton. 
1. Dependency Injection - research best approach for Avalonia gven plugin system has no App.cs or Main to reference.
1. App Update process
1. Get messaging set up right - must alow for multiple servers (each installation) with multiple clients (app on different machines)
1. UI design:
	1. Theming
	1. Page Navigation
	1.
